Soccer-Caldwell can be Wigan's long-term saviour - Sharpe
</title>
<description>
Wigan Athletic need a miracle to avoid their second relegation in three seasons but new manager Gary Caldwell is the right long-term appointment for the English Championship club, chairman David Sharpe said on Wednesday. Wigan, who won the FA Cup and were relegated from the Premier League in 2013, are 23rd in the second tier -- eight points from safety with five games remaining. Caldwell, who played 111 games for Wigan but retired earlier this season because of a persistent hip injury, replaces Malky Mackay as manager following the Scot's dismissal on Monday after a 2-0 home defeat by Derby County.

<title>Soccer-Gomis says will stay at Swansea next season</title>
<description>
Former France international Bafetimbi Gomis said he will stay at Swansea City next season after hinting earlier he could leave the Premier League club. The 29-year-old striker, who won 12 caps with Les Bleus from 2008-13, said in January that it was "possible" he could leave the club. "I see myself here next season," Gomis, now the main striker at Swansea since Wilfried Bony left for Manchester City during the January transfer window, told French sports daily L'Equipe's website (www.lequipe.fr) on Wednesday. I'm now very well in Swansea." Gomis, who joined from Olympique Lyonnais during the close season, has scored eight goals for Swansea.

Soccer-FC Seoul call on AFC to bring in goalline technology
</title>
<description>
FC Seoul have called on the Asian Football Confederation to implement goalline technology in its competitions after being denied a winning goal in the dying stages of their 1-1 draw with Champions League holders Western Sydney Wanderers on Tuesday. With the clock ticking past the 90-minute mark, Seoul's Lee Woong-hee hooked a shot towards goal which goalkeeper Ante Covic got a hand to before scrambling back to gather on his line. "The missed call came at a crucial juncture that could have a bearing on securing a spot in the round of 16, and we expressed deep concerns with the AFC," Seoul were quoted as saying by Yonhap on Wednesday. "We also asked the AFC to prevent the recurrence of similar cases and to adopt the goalline technology to ensure the development of Asian football." Goalline technology was used at last year's World Cup and is adopted in the English Premier League but the cost to implement it is understood to be a problem for many associations.

Soccer-Figo disputes CAF claim of all-Africa backing for Blatter
</title>
<description>
By Mark Gleeson CAIRO, April 8 (Reuters) - FIFA presidential candidate Luis Figo on Wednesday disputed the Confederation of African Football's claim that all 54 votes from the continent will go to incumbent Sepp Blatter in the presidential elections next month. The former Portugal international, in Egypt at the CAF Congress to canvass for votes, told Reuters he did not believe all Africa was solidly behind Blatter, who seeks re-election on May 29 against Figo, Prince Ali bin Al Hussein of Jordan and the Dutch football association president Michael van Praag. "I feel there's a lot of respect for CAF among all the African federations but I'm positive that (CAF president) Mr (Issa) Hayatou did not speak in the name of the 54 members of the confederation," said the former Barcelona and Real Madrid midfielder.

Soccer-Montreal first Canada team to reach CONCACAF Champs League final
</title>
<description>
(Adds dropped word in headline) April 8 (Reuters) - Montreal Impact became the first Canadian team to reach the CONCACAF Champions League final after a 4-2 defeat at Costa Rica's Alajuelense on Tuesday saw them advance on the away goals rule. Montreal, who won the first leg 2-0, will face the winner of the second semi-final between Mexico's Club America and another Costa Rican side, Herediano, who won the first leg 3-0. Impact took the lead three minutes before half-time at the Alejandro Morera Soto stadium when Dominic Oduro's cross was confidently struck home first time by Jack McInerney. Alajuelense pulled level just after the break through a thundering free-kick from Pablo Gabas, who struck again in the 61st minute with a volley to put the home side up 2-1 on the night.

Soccer-Sagan Tosu defender banned for four games after stamp
</title>
<description>
Sagan Tosu defender Kim Min-hyeok was handed a four game ban by the J-League on Tuesday after being found guilty of stamping on an opponent in a Japanese top flight game. The South Korean's foot connected with the face of Kashima Antlers player Mu Kanazaki as the two tangled near the touchline. The J-League described the act as "violent conduct and/or threatening another player" after the Antlers asked for a review following their 3-1 win on Friday, with Tosu sorry for their player's behaviour. "We would like to reiterate our deepest apologies to Kashima Antlers' Mu Kanazaki and the rest of the club for Kim Min Hyeok's behaviour," Tosu said in a statement on Tuesday.

Soccer-Bhutan praying for dream Japan tie in World Cup
</title>
<description>
By Patrick Johnston April 8 (Reuters) - When the second round draw for Asian World Cup qualifying takes place in Kuala Lumpur next week, fans, players and officials in the tiny Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan will be praying for one outcome. "The people here want Japan because most of the youth out here are fans of Kagawa because he played for Manchester United," Bhutan Football Federation official Phutsho Wangdi told Reuters. "Japan would be the first choice and especially our players too. We grew up watching them." There is another reason to want Shinji Kagawa, Keisuke Honda and the rest of the record four-times Asian champion's squad to play at the picturesque Changlimithang Stadium - money.

Soccer-Peru clubs slow to get work permits for foreign players
</title>
<description>
Several Peruvian clubs could face stiff penalties for fielding foreign players without obtaining work permits, immigration and tax officials said on Tuesday. Only seven of 17 first division clubs had begun to put their foreign players papers in order since being called upon to do so, the National Immigration Superintendents' office said in a statement. "It is important to note that another 20 footballers have not applied yet (for work permits) and they and their clubs are called on ... to comply with Peruvian law," it said. Tax attorney Edgardo Bernuy told the America television channel that clubs were saving about 30 percent in taxes by not seeking work permits for their foreign players and they faced fines of up to $100,000.

Soccer-Arango banned for two Mexican league matches for biting
</title>
<description>
Tijuana midfielder Juan Arango has been suspended for two matches for biting an opponent in a Mexican championship match, the Mexican Football Federation said on its website. Venezuela captain Arango bit Monterrey defender Jesus Zavala on the shoulder in the final minutes of Tijuana's 4-3 home defeat on Saturday. Arango apologised to Zavala and the pair exchanged shirts after the match. The incident was reminiscent of Uruguayan Luis Suarez's bite on Italian Giorgio Cheillini's shoulder during last year's World Cup.

Soccer-Benteke form hands Villa boost in basement battle
</title>
<description>
Christian Benteke has rediscovered his scoring touch at the perfect time and Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood knows that could be crucial in their battle to avoid relegation from the Premier League. The Belgian targetman looked a forlorn shadow of his best in the first seven months of the season, but a hat-trick in Tuesday's pulsating 3-3 draw with Queens Park Rangers confirmed he is back on top form. While his triple strike only gained Villa a point at home to relegation rivals QPR, with six games remaining the striker could yet prove crucial to his side on the run-in. "Christian Benteke was very good, the second goal especially was excellent.

Soccer-Atletico hard on Real's heels, Sevilla down Levante
</title>
<description>
* Atletico stroll to 2-0 win at home to Sociedad * Sevilla level with Valencia after win at Levante (Adds Levante-Sevilla result, byline) By Iain Rogers MADRID, April 7 (Reuters) - Atletico Madrid made a typically aggressive start to lay the foundations for a 2-0 victory at home to mid-table Real Sociedad on Tuesday that lifted the champions to within two points of second-placed Real Madrid. Diego Simeone's men came roaring out of the blocks at the Calderon and, after Arda Turan had thumped a volley against the post in the second minute, Koke's inswinging delivery from a corner moments later was headed into his own net by Sociedad defender Mikel Gonzalez. Antoine Griezmann made it 2-0 in the 10th minute when he followed up Koke's saved effort and clipped the ball into the roof of the net for his 16th La Liga goal of the campaign.

Soccer-Benteke nets hat-trick as Villa and QPR draw 3-3
</title>
<description>
(Add details, Benteke quote) LONDON, April 7 (Reuters) - Christian Benteke's superb hat-trick rescued a potentially priceless Premier League point for Aston Villa, who twice came back from a goal down to draw 3-3 on Tuesday with relegation rivals Queens Park Rangers. Benteke's free kick with seven minutes to play completed a precious treble and secured a draw that moved hosts Villa up to 16th, three points above the relegation zone while 18th-placed QPR's plight remains perilous. QPR had taken the lead through Matt Phillips, before Benteke turned the match on its head with his first two goals in the opening 45 minutes. Veteran Clint Hill levelled shortly after the break with a header and Charlie Austin snatched his 17th goal of the season to restore QPR's lead.

Soccer-Villa's Benteke nets hat-trick in 3-3 basement battle with QPR
</title>
<description>
Christian Benteke's superb hat-trick rescued a potentially priceless point for Aston Villa, who twice came back from a goal down to draw 3-3 on Tuesday with relegation rivals Queens Park Rangers. Benteke's free kick with seven minutes to play completed a precious treble and secured a draw that moved hosts Villa up to 16th, three points above the relegation zone while 18th-placed QPR's plight remains perilous. QPR had taken the lead through Matt Phillips, before Benteke turned the match on its head with his first two goals in the opening 45 minutes.

Soccer-Atletico hard on Real's heels after dismissing Sociedad
</title>
<description>
Atletico Madrid made a typically aggressive start to lay the foundations for a 2-0 victory at home to mid-table Real Sociedad on Tuesday that lifted the champions to within two points of second-placed Real Madrid. Diego Simeone's men came roaring out of the blocks at the Calderon and, after Arda Turan had thumped a volley against the post in the second minute, Koke's inswinging delivery from a corner moments later was headed into his own net by Sociedad defender Mikel Gonzalez. Antoine Griezmann made it 2-0 in the 10th minute when he followed up Koke's saved effort and clipped the ball into the roof of the net for his 16th La Liga goal of the campaign. Sociedad, who have improved since former Manchester United manager David Moyes took over as coach in November, never looked like getting back into the game, substitute Esteban Granero coming closest for the Basque club with a curling free kick two minutes from time.
