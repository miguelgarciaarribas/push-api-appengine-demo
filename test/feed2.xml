Soccer-Bhutan leap 46 places in FIFA rankings, Belgium go third
</title>
<description>
April 9 (Reuters) - Bhutan jumped 46 places from the foot of the FIFA rankings to 163rd on Thursday after recording their first ever World Cup qualifying victories. The Himalayan nation beat Sri Lanka 1-0 in Colombo and 2-1 in Thimphu last month to advance to the second round of Asian qualifying and, after reaching their highest ranking, will be among the fourth seeds for Tuesday's draw. Anguilla replaced Bhutan as FIFA's 209th and lowest ranked international side after losing 8-0 on aggregate to Nicaragua in the first round of CONCACAF World Cup qualifying last month. ...

Soccer-Napoli president threatens to send players to training camp
</title>
<description>
Napoli president Aurelio Di Laurentiis has threatened to send his players to a training camp "for an unlimited period of time" if they do not improve between now and the end of the season. Di Laurentiis was furious after his team continued their recent slide by losing 1-0 at home to Lazio in the second leg of their Coppa Italia semi-final on Wednesday, going down 2-1 on aggregate. The elimination came on top of a run of five Serie A matches without a win which has seen Napoli drop from third place to sixth, leaving them with only a faint chance of qualifying for the Champions League next season. "I dislike the idea of a training camp as part of the club's philosophy, but Naples is a city which is full of distractions," he added.

Soccer-Emery-inspired Sevilla well set for Barca visit
</title>
<description>
By Iain Rogers MADRID, April 9 (Reuters) - Sevilla coach Unai Emery is one of the more eccentric characters in La Liga but the Andalusian club's success this season suggests there is plenty of method in the Basque-born 43-year-old's apparent madness. Sevilla are fifth in La Liga ahead of the visit of leaders Barcelona on Saturday. "Since he arrived there has been a clear upwards trend," midfielder Vicente Iborra said of Emery, who joined Sevilla in Jannuary 2013, on the club's radio station on Wednesday. Having a coach and training staff like that is to be valued, it's not easy and we have to, and will, make the most of it." After a run of five straight victories they are well placed to secure at least a berth in the Europa League, the competition they won last season and are still alive in this term.

<title>Soccer-Chelsea bid for FC Tokyo striker Muto</title>
<description>
English Premier League leaders Chelsea have bid for FC Tokyo's Japanese international striker Yoshinori Muto, the J-League side said on Thursday. The 22-year-old, who has scored once for his country in 11 appearances, has "not made any decision yet" on a possible move, Kyodo News reported the Japanese club as saying on Thursday. The shrewd striker only graduated two weeks ago from Keio University after completing an economics degree and would not be eligible to move until the transfer window opens in England in June. The new J-League season started last month and Muto has impressed, notching three goals in his first four appearances to help Tokyo sit third.

<title>Soccer-America's Goltz has ban cut to three games</title>
<description>
America defender Paolo Goltz has had a six-match ban for kicking a grounded opponent in the head during a CONCACAF Champions League tie reduced to three on appeal. Goltz kicked Cristhian Lagos of Costa Rican side Herediano during America's 3-0 away defeat in the semi-final first leg on March 17. "The Appeals Committee found, after an extensive analysis of the evidence at its disposal, that it cannot be established that Paolo Goltz intentionally kicked his opponent Cristhian Lagos," CONCACAF said in a statement on Wednesday.

Soccer-Controversial Al Shamrani retakes AFC scoring mark
</title>
<description>
On Wednesday he made the most of the Court of Arbitration for Sport's decision to temporarily stay his eight-match ban for spitting and head butting an opponent to score the opener in Al Hilal's 2-0 win over Iranians Foolad in the AFC Champions League. His diving header was his 26th in the tournament, which took him clear of former South Korean international Lee Dong-gook in the Champions League all-time scorer charts. His feat, though, was marked with little fanfare by the Asian Football Confederation (AFC), who celebrated Lee pulling level last month with a profile of the Jeonbuk striker, but remain clearly irked by the Saudi's failure to accept their punishment. The ban, six for clearly spitting at Western Sydney Wanderers Matthew Spiranovic and two for head-butting, were the minimum Al Shamrani could have received after the incident following the 1-0 aggregate defeat in the November final.

Soccer-River cling to Libertadores hopes with late rally in Mexico
</title>
<description>
By Rex Gowar April 8 (Reuters) - River Plate scored twice in the closing three minutes to grab an unlikely 2-2 draw at Mexico's UANL Tigres in the Libertadores Cup on Wednesday. The Argentine giants' hopes of qualifying for the last 16 looked dead and buried with just minutes left after Egidio Arevalo Rios and Damian Alvarez had put the Mexican side 2-0 up. River pulled one back through striker Teofilo Gutierrez, who pounced on a rebound after Rodrigo Mora's shot had been parried by goalkeeper Nahuel Guzman. Man of the Match Mora then scored the equaliser with an exquisite volley from Gutierrez's square ball in the final minute to keep River in the hunt until the final round of Group Six games next week.

Soccer-United primed to resume Manchester top-dog role
</title>
<description>
By Michael Hann LONDON, April 9 (Reuters) - Manchester United, buoyed by five successive Premier League victories, head into Sunday's derby against Manchester City a place and a point above their rivals and believing they are poised to restore red ascendancy in the city. Champions City have won the last four league meetings against United, including a 1-0 victory at the Etihad Stadium in November, but their hopes of retaining the title have faded. They have dropped down to fourth after four wins in 11 league games and trail leaders Chelsea by nine points. United, meanwhile, have put their early season struggles behind them to climb to third, eight points clear of fifth-placed Liverpool in the race for Champions League qualification.

* Ronaldo scores opener in 2-0 La Liga victory * Suarez hits double in Barca win over Almeria * Barca stay four points clear at the top (Adds Ancelotti quotes) By Iain Rogers MADRID, April 8 (Reuters) - Cristiano Ronald headed his 300th goal for Real Madrid in a laboured 2-0 La Liga victory at neighbours Rayo Vallecano on Wednesday that kept the gap on leaders Barcelona down to four points. Fresh from thrashing Granada 9-1, when Ronaldo hit five, the European champions needed a win at Rayo's Vallecas stadium after Barca strolled to a 4-0 home victory over Almeria to open a seven-point advantage over their arch-rivals.

Soccer-Deportivo fire coach after draw with bottom side Cordoba
</title>
<description>
Deportivo La Coruna have fired coach Victor Fernandez after a 1-1 draw at home to bottom side Cordoba on Wednesday left the Galician club hovering just above the La Liga relegation places. "The board of directors ... has informed Victor Fernandez that from tonight he is no longer the first team coach," Deportivo said on their website (www.canaldeportivo.com). As soon as a replacement is found the club president will hold a news conference. Fernandez, who has also had stints in charge at clubs including Real Betis, Real Zaragoza and Porto, was appointed in July but a run of eight La Liga games without a win forced the board's hand.

Soccer-Treble-chasing Barca riding high before crucial run
</title>
<description>
By Iain Rogers MADRID, April 8 (Reuters) - Fired by the goals of Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez, treble-chasing Barcelona are riding high before four games over 10 days that could make or break coach Luis Enrique's first season in charge. Wednesday's 4-0 La Liga victory over Almeria, which maintained their four-point advantage over Real Madrid at the top, was a more than satisfactory warm-up for Saturday's game at fifth-placed Sevilla. The clash at the Sanchez Pizjuan is followed by the two-legged Champions League quarter-final against Paris St Germain, with a La Liga match at home to fourth-placed Valencia in between.

Soccer-Lazio oust holders Napoli to put heat on Benitez
</title>
<description>
Senad Lulic scored a late goal to give Lazio a 1-0 win at Napoli which sent them into the Coppa Italia final and added to Rafael Benitez's problems on Wednesday. Holders Napoli went into the match as favourites after drawing 1-1 away in the first leg of the semi-final but were knocked out after a familiar tale of missed chances and poor defending. Napoli coach Benitez was under pressure after his side slipped from third to sixth in Serie A, leaving their Champions League qualification hopes in tatters, and retaining the Coppa was seen as a chance to salvage their season.

Soccer-Coutinho goal sends Liverpool into FA Cup semi-final
</title>
<description>
(Adds details, quotes) LONDON, April 8 (Reuters) - Philippe Coutinho thumped home a second-half winner as Liverpool broke the resistance of Championship Blackburn Rovers to reach the FA Cup semi-finals with a gritty 1-0 replay victory on Wednesday. Brendan Rodgers's side, who came into the game after back-to-back Premier League defeats that all but ended their hopes of a top-four finish, will face Aston Villa in a Wembley semi-final. They came out on top at Ewood Park having dominated possession but struggled to break down the hosts who got men behind the ball and restricted Liverpool to very few sights of goal. The breakthrough came in the 70th minute when Coutinho exchanged passes with Jordan Henderson from a corner, drove into the box and drilled the ball low into the bottom corner.

Soccer-Croatia ordered to play Italy behind closed doors
</title>
<description>
(Adds background) BERNE, April 8 (Reuters) - Croatia will play their Euro 2016 qualifier at home to Italy behind closed doors after their fans caused more trouble during the 5-1 win over Norway, UEFA said on Wednesday. UEFA's disciplinary panel lost patience with Croatia following racist behaviour and the "setting off/throwing of missiles and fireworks" by their fans during the Group H match at Zagreb's Maksimir stadium on March 28. UEFA, which did not give any further details, also fined the Croatia federation 50,000 euros ($53,925) . The match was played in a partially closed stadium following trouble at Croatia's 1-1 draw in Italy in November in another group game.
